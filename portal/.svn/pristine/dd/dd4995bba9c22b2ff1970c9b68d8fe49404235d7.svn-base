					<b>"To provide best resources and guidance with a real time
						approach to the young graduates and job seekers stepping out to
						face the crucial corporate interviews that would define their
						destiny"</b>
				</h5>
				<br>
				<lable> TMI is founded by leaders from varied corporate
				domains with over seventeen years of experience across the
				verticals. Our dynamic crew has observed and experienced the
				corporate world for years and has learned to recognize trends and
				habits of the job markets.<br>
				<br>
				With increasing pressure on young adults to succeed straight out of
				college, there is a keen necessity for better preparedness. We
				realised that students and job seekers require help in acing their
				interviews. A personalised interaction with the happening business
				leaders will empower the latent talent to face the interviews
				better.<br>
				<br>
				With providing students specialized training, TMI also aims to help
				educational institutions and industries. We ensure that talented,
				well-educated young individuals do not slip through the cracks just
				because they are not personable enough at first glance. We help
				students and job seekers get grounded, stabilised and establish
				themselves as confident individuals before they enter the job
				market. <br>
				<br>
				Our panel of experts have approached the problems through multiple
				angles, identifying the key traits that lead to success. We have
				moulded our experience into something that can be taught to those in
				need. Our founders are keen to help young, determined and ambitious
				students attain their goals with the highest degree of success
				possible. <br>
				<br>
				TMI's constant aim is to create an exchange system between the three
				components involved - students, the college and the corporation. <br>
				<br>
				Our visionaries have recognized that if these three aspects start
				working together, they are engaged in a mutually beneficial
				relationship. Corporations can help institutions develop more
				realistic educational practices, which in turn would help the
				students be better prepared. Better student preparedness would lead
				to better potential employees for the corporations. <br>
				<br>
				At TMI, we realized that a cyclical relationship needs to be
				cultivated and maintained for the benefit of all. With this in mind,
				we have modelled ourselves to be a conduit through which this
				relationship would flow. <br>
				<br>
				At present, we have connections in both sides of the world. Our
				network is deeply entrenched in the corporate sector. We have
				developed healthy relationships with various national and
				multi-national companies. We wish to allow our clients to benefit
				from these relationships. <br>
				<br>
				TMI has a large interview platform. It draws from our experience
				with all prevalent industries, allowing us to give the students and
				job seekers a complete package of services. Since we interact with
				only the best, our clients have access to the top industry leaders
				who will enable the students have edge over other potential job
				candidates.</lable>
