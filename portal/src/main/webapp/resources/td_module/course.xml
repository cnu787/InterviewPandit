Few interviewers are trained to conduct excellent interviews. To enhance your success at interviewing there are things you need to do before, during and after the interview.
To begin with, there are three basic criteria that need to be addressed when you conduct an interview: 
Can the candidate do the job? 
Will the candidate fit in? 
Is this the best candidate for the position?  
In the context of a mock interview, it is your responsibility to assess and prepare the candidate to achieve the above criteria.

You will need to complete the feedback form online separately for each individual candidate.
                The feedback form contains three distinct areas for evaluating candidates based on KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, and ATTITUDE(KSA).

                The next seven sections have three different probing questions each and focus on the SKILLS of the candidate. You may choose to ask one or more of these or similar questions. 
                The final four sections focus on the overarching ATTITUDE, behavior and communication skills.
